Recently, the $500 billion Stargate project was announced—a massive initiative to build AI infrastructure datacenters for OpenAI.

I've always been fascinated by decentralized systems and protocols for their technical potential. However, blockchain has largely been reduced to meme coins, NFTs, and scams in the public eye, often failing to deliver real-world utility.

Blockchain technology is impressive, but forcing use cases where they aren't needed has plagued the industry. Many projects attempt to integrate blockchain into processes that simply don’t require decentralization—IoT, social media, and other applications that function perfectly well without it.

However, when we start discussing decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), things get genuinely interesting. That’s where Cxmpute comes in—a real-world use case that *needs* crypto.

### What is Cxmpute?
Cxmpute is a decentralized compute network. Instead of relying on massive centralized data centers in Texas or Tennessee, Cxmpute distributes computing power globally, allowing anyone with an eligible computer to join and monetize their idle compute resources.

This approach enables the creation of an extensive distributed datacenter without the need for enormous upfront investments—unlike OpenAI’s half-trillion-dollar endeavor. Cxmpute scales naturally, and the vision is for it to become the world’s largest decentralized datacenter. I firmly believe in this potential.

One of the greatest advantages of Cxmpute is cost-efficiency. As more providers join, competition will drive prices down, making decentralized computing cost-competitive—and eventually cheaper—than centralized cloud services.

Furthermore, wealth is distributed among the network's nodes rather than concentrated within a single corporation. This creates a new store of value, backed by physical infrastructure: compute power.

This is an incredibly high-potential space.

### Decentralized Compute with Versatility
Different compute services require varying hardware specifications, allowing for flexible node participation. Some users may rent out their computers only while they sleep, while others may build dedicated AI inference servers running continuously to profit from decentralized large language model (LLM) inference.

This versatility further strengthens Cxmpute’s long-term viability. The intersection of decentralization and flexibility ensures that Cxmpute isn’t just a fleeting trend—it’s a sustainable solution.

### Cxmpute's Offerings
Cxmpute provides a broad range of compute services, ensuring both provider and user demand:

- **Virtual Machines** – General-use VMs, optimized for GPU, memory, CPU, and storage, depending on provider hardware. The goal is to offer a diverse selection of VMs to maximize both supply and demand.
- **Serverless Compute** – A decentralized alternative to AWS Lambda.
- **Serverless Containers** – Similar to AWS Fargate, but decentralized.
- **Decentralized AI Inference** – The Cxmpute API (api.cxmpute.xyz) hosts a vast selection of models, offering a serverless inference service. Users can also host dedicated models exclusively for their own use.
- **Decentralized AI Archive** – In addition to inference, models are available for download. Since Cxmpute is stored on a decentralized network, the archive is censorship-resistant.
- **Distributed AI Training** – Kubernetes-enabled decentralized AI training, allowing for large-scale machine learning workloads.
- **Agxnt** – A practical application of Cxmpute’s compute capabilities. More details below.

### Agxnt: AI Agents-as-a-Service
Given the rising interest in AI agents, Cxmpute also offers agent endpoints—essentially Agents-as-a-Service. While vertical AI SaaS products are great, most AI agents are built from the same fundamental components. That’s what Agxnts provides: modular AI agents that users can combine into workflows through the Cxmpute UI, API, or their own implementations.

Providers host Agxnt engines, ensuring that requests are quickly processed by the appropriate agent. These requests can range from simple tasks (e.g., generating a video or creating a presentation) to highly specialized functions, such as AI-driven medical research.

#### Available Agents
Cxmpute’s Agxnts cover a comprehensive range of functionalities:

- **Data & Memory:** Write Memory, Search Memory, Ask Memory, Clear Memory, Delete Memory, Update Memory
- **Code Execution:** Codexecution, Sequential Code
- **AI Generation:** Image Gen, Video Gen, PDF Gen, Notebook, Presentation Gen, Text-to-Speech
- **Web & Internet Tools:** Internet, Internet Dive, Deep Internet, Browser Use, Sequential Internet
- **Social Media & Messaging:** YouTube, Discord, Twitter, Telegram
- **Databases & Storage:** Dxtabase, Sequential Memory
- **Automation & Orchestration:** Step

By leveraging these agents, users can replicate at least 95% of existing AI agent offerings and automate over 90% of digital workflows.

### Pricing Model
Cxmpute operates on a flexible pricing system, determined by both users and providers:

- Providers set their price per compute unit/second for different service categories when registering.
- Users specify a price range when deploying code to serverless compute or containers.
- Cxmpute matches users with providers based on these parameters.
- Users can also rent containers or servers by the hour or month for reliable, non-serverless applications.

### Getting Started
Cxmpute is designed with simplicity in mind. From past experience, I’ve learned that usability is key—so the website and onboarding process are redundant-proof, straightforward, and user-friendly. Getting started is easy—just visit **cxmpute.xyz**.

**Fun fact:** Cxmpute.xyz is hosted *completely* on-chain, thanks to the Internet Computer Protocol. You can read more about how Cxmpute's architecture [here](https://joshuaokolo.vercel.app/blog/cxmputearchitecture).
