This is a long description, but I encourage you to read it fully—you won't find another project like this.

Introducing Levlex: The Future of Artificial Intelligence

Levlex isn't just another AI tool. It’s a bold reimagining of what AI can do for individuals and businesses, directly on your device.

Unlike the sprawling ecosystem of expensive, cloud-based AI services that burn through investor capital and user patience, Levlex is private, efficient, and built to last.

Running AI in the cloud is prohibitively expensive. Many startups, even those backed by massive companies, are losing money hand over fist trying to keep up with operational costs. 

The issue comes from the fact than running AI models in the cloud is exponentially expensive, and doesn’t scale the same way traditional software-as-a-service scales. 

And even though the big names are bankrolled by big companies, like not so OpenAI bankrolled by Microsoft, etc, you can’t burn money for too long.

Imagine having a $200 monthly subscription and still losing money. That’s what OpenAI is currently facing.

Perplexity, who initially claimed to be the competitor to google, only grows to resemble google as they abandon their initial pure-AI search to incorporate paid advertising and weaker models which pollutes the results and results in user dissatisfaction.

This isn’t sustainable.

Not to mention all the AI slop GPT wrappers which offer no unique new benefit or innovation. The concept of a GPT wrapper isn’t inherently bad— but it has to be something useful, and most aren’t, which is a problem because now there is an over saturation of AI slop.

If your startup doesn’t improve with the intelligence of AI models improving, your AI SAAS is dead. If OpenAI can render your product obsolete with a feature update, you’re not innovating enough.

But enough about calling out names. What is Levlex?

Levlex is on-device AI, leveraging the power of your own hardware to deliver faster, more reliable, and completely private AI experiences.

The benefits? Plentiful. Your data is completely private, no need for you to worry about companies prying into your information or collecting your data to sell and profit.

The models you’re running, because they’re downloaded and run on your computer, don’t vary in quality, whereas cloud services frequently change out models to reduce costs during peak hours. 

Moreover, these services also cuck you and rate limit the number of messages you can have with different models, and take away features like file uploads and image uploads.

You don’t have to worry about any of this with levlex.

In fact, Levlex is only limited by hardware, and by Moore’s law, hardware will only improve. A very recent example, some days ago NVIDIA’s CEO announced DIGITS, an AI PC that’s only $3,000 and has 192GB of ram, built for the purpose of running AI on-device. Previously a computer with that much ram costs at least $20k, just for RAM. 

For further context, for levlex to barely work on-device, your computer needs 16GB of RAM, 32Gb grants fast and comfortable use. 192GB? The throughput you will experience on that device will beat any cloud service you interact with, not to mention that after purchasing Levlex it’s free: no more subscription.

When you purchase Levlex, you own it. No subscriptions. No hidden costs. This return to the "buy once, own forever" model is not just nostalgic—it’s practical.

That’s a big issue I’ve had with modern software and trends. The first obvious example is the fragmentation of streaming services and how you’d need to be paying over $20+ every month to over 5+ providers if you wanted to watch the latest and most engaging shows.

The same thing is happening with software, even worse with AI. Because unlike traditional software, AI costs scale rapidly by user usage, simply because the AI models are huge. They’re not called Large Language Models for nothing. So you find yourself paying much more than $20 a month for a single SAAS.

I have built SAAS in the past. Traditional software is easily max $1 a month in operations cost per user. Generative AI software? Even with rate and word count limits, I was still facing a minimum price of $100 per user. 

Levlex eliminates the need for all this, and reintroduces the buy once own forever model. There might be concern of “oh but how do you keep making money?”

By selling more. NVIDIA is a hardware manufacturer, and their sales have only increased over time. As long as people are buying GPUs, as long as custom building PCs and the whole PC building market exists, as long as there are people and professionals who don’t want to be left behind or replaced by AI. There will be a market for Levlex.

Moreover, Levlex is built to be customized and extensible. Similar to how the Apple ecosystem also has an app marketplace that enables developers to make money off apps and crates a community layer on top of their devices, Levlex will do the same thing.

But more specifics about what Levlex actually is, because I must support my claim that levlex introduces innovative AI user experiences.

The biggest one is the concept of Workflows.

Until recently, you couldn’t have AI execute tasks for you, and the current startups built on providing a service where AI automates some work for you, are slop to me, and the reason is that they are only contributing to the fragmentation of the AI landscape, and you could replace their startup with a singular Levlex Workflow 95% of the time (my goal is to bring this up to 100% of the time).

Traditionally, AI right now is prompt to text. You ask it something, it gives you an answer. It’s closer to a glorified google than an actual JARVIS-like assistant.

That’s what levlex aims to be, a JARVIS-like assistant integrated with your digital environment that executes tasks for you and automates the bs, so you can focus on more important things and run laps around your competitors.

A workflow is consisted or agents, which you organize as you like, and these agents then execute tasks based on their niche, and this can amplify your workflow.

This is best illustrated with an example. Let’s say you want to monitor financial markets. You create a workflow that starts with the internet research agent, which first gets a semantic view of what the internet is saying about a specific token or project. 

You then use the custom Solana agent to query the Solana blockchain and retrieve and analyze the actual blockchain transactions.

Add a node which generates a report of its findings.

Add a node which adds the report to your Levlex AI Notebook.
Set this to run every day.

And with that, you have a financial analyst working for you. It’s also not hard to see how rapidly this will improve with the advancement of ai research and the release of smarter models.

There’s a myriad of agents, and we will continue to build and iterate more over time. You can see the full current list at our website levlex.xyz

Give me any AI agent SAAS startup and I will show you how to implement it as a workflow in Levlex. You could even perform this exercise yourself.

The next innovation is that of making jobs not execute whenever you prompt Levlex, but also be able to be recurring, or scheduled. Now you can run tasks every cadence that you set. Like the finance example, or a weekly news workflow.

Levlex is innovative because it goes past these basic uses. For example, you can set up a workflow to have Levlex automatically penetration test (red-team hack) your smart contracts to find vulnerabilities before they hit the chain and become permanent. This could be applied to any software, not just blockchain.

Another specific but strong and widely applicable innovation of levlex is AI knowledge discovery. 

If you have a big database, it’s impossible for a human to read through it all, but not for AI. This is the premise of the Levlex Knowledge Discovery Agent. It recursively searches the internet, local files, or a database, based on which you provided it access to, and researches and analyses, and generates reports.

This will be game-changing for industries where consuming a large amount of information is a necessity. Since we live in the age where information is money, this is an innovative feature. 

Most AI search services right now basically work by scraping the first few results off google or an other search engine, then prompting an LLM to generate a response (btw this another agent Levlex has built in).

However, there are some answers where you must dive deep to find. That is why there is a basic internet search, and knowledge discovery, as well as Dive, which serves as an intermediate, a balance between searching and the time it takes to an answer.

Imagine being able to ask an AI a question, and it tells you, I do’t know, but I’ll find an answer and get back to you, and it goes off and researchers. This is a truly innovative feature.

Levlex also provides chambers, which is a way for you to create AI agents/personalities, and have them discuss with one another, and also participate in the discussion yourself.

For developers, you can create custom agents and even interact with Levlex from the terminal.

There is also the AI notebook feature, which creates a convenient way to store notes and generate and edit content.

You can also talk with documents with the DocuChat feature.

And you can access levlex anytime on your computer with a simply shortcut on your computer: Levlex can also see your screen and answer based on the context of your screen: remember, this is all running privately on your computer, so you don’t have to worry about a third party service seeing your activities.

There is also a normal chat interface, which also provides in-chat access to these agents. For example, you could have the YouTube agent summarize a YouTube video for you.

In a similar vein, Levlex has an AI-powered read it later feature, which allows you to copy any long piece of text, and Levlex will summarize/analyze the text into a bite sized bit, so you don’t have to waste time reading yap on the internet.

Moreover, you can combine all these features, and the features I didn’t mention (there is a long list of features, see levlex.xyz or the demo for a comprehensive overview) into workspaces (Levlex Spaces feature). There’s also Docks, which serves as an internal filesystem for your features.

Levlex Spaces allows you to create a fancy multi-window UI that combines these features and lets you use multiple of them simultaneously. 

And if you still want to use cloud based models, either because your device is limited on compute power or whatever other reason you want to ignore the safety and reliability concerns and use a cloud api, you can still do that and have a cloud model power Levlex.

Levlex can do almost everything you need AI to do for you.

Generate images.

Automate away tasks.

Attend meetings for you.

The list goes on, with the goal of levlex having EVERYTHING you need for ai in this one platform. Along with being private and no subscription by default, with the option to utilize cloud services if you wish. Not to mention you can create custom extensions and agents.

You can also make beautiful dashboards combining all these features into one interface so you can use multiple tools at once. This is going to unlock unprecedented levels of productivity. 

There’s no need to juggle a million AI tools with endless subscriptions when a few solid AI agents can handle 90% + of your needs. Levlex is a game-changer for B2B and B2C
